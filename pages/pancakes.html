    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking soda</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>3 cups buttermilk</li>
      <li>½ cup milk</li>
      <li>3 eggs</li>
      <li>⅓ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Beat together buttermilk, milk,
        eggs, and melted butter in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you are ready to cook.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. You can flick water across the surface and
        if it beads up and sizzles, it's ready.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon or fork to mix until it's just blended together.
        The batter will be a little lumpy which is what you want.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 1/2 cup for each pancake. Cook until
        bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2 minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side.
        Repeat with remaining batter.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
